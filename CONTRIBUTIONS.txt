CONTRIBUTIONS:

cpu.v:
Partner 1 and Partner 2 both worked on the ControllerFSM module to create new states for the branch instructions.
New states that were created were made to help the timing of each instruction to execute what is needed. Both partners
chose to get rid of state UpdatePC and IF2 to reduce the time for the code to execute. To implement table 1 of the lab, 
we changed the mux for the PC to update the PC values accordingly. We changed the datapath PC value to the lab7 version + 1
as we get the value for R7 by just adding one to the original PC. We then instantiated this change acccordingly. 
The most challenging obstacle was to figure out how to time the changes of the PC and when  to set load_pc to 1. We 
had to refer to the timing diagram provided in lab 7 many times in order to ensure we were doing everything correctly. This 
was especially hard since we removed the IF2 and Update PC states

Testing:
Both partners put in extensive effort to analyze the waveforms and deduce any issues with the existing code. Upon making 
the necessary changes, our designs were able to pass autograder, the stage 2 testbench, as well as some modified versions 
of the stage2 testbench.

lab8_top.v:
Both partners worked together to make the minor modifications to the top_module in order to make it compatible with the 50 MHz clock
